## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1 Hardware Received

```
Checklist per device:
[ ] Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB recommended)
[ ] MicroSD card (32GB Class 10)
[ ] USB-C power supply (5V 3A)
[ ] Case with cooling (ArgonOne recommended)
[ ] Webcam (Logitech C920/C922)
[ ] HDMI cable
```

### 2.2 Accounts Created

```
For each room:
[ ] Meeting account created (room-X@company.com)
[ ] Calendar shared with appropriate users
[ ] Meeting platform license assigned
[ ] Password documented securely
```

### 2.3 Network Ready

```
[ ] WiFi credentials documented
[ ] Firewall rules implemented
[ ] Test device can reach required endpoints
[ ] Dashboard server network access confirmed
```

### 2.4 Build Machine Ready

For image preparation, you need:
- Ubuntu 20.04+ workstation/VM
- SD card reader
- Required tools installed:

```bash
# Install prerequisites
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git wget xz-utils tree
```

---

## 3. Dashboard Deployment

### Current implementation status

The standalone Pi installer deploys the Python agent. It does not deploy the
separate fleet management dashboard or open port 3000.

The dashboard sources in this repository consist of a React/Vite frontend
(`src/croom-dashboard/frontend`, development port 3000), an Express backend
(`src/croom-dashboard/backend`, default port 3001), and PostgreSQL models.
There is no dashboard Compose file or Django `manage.py` in this repository.
The earlier Docker and Django deployment commands in this section did not match
these sources and have been removed.

A supported dashboard deployment still needs a complete build and service setup,
database/account provisioning, authentication validation, and agent enrollment
integration. The current standalone agent explicitly rejects a configured dashboard
URL because that enrollment/client integration is not implemented for its current API.
Starting a frontend alone would not provide working room management.

For the implemented single-room workflow, `croom-ui` starts a native touchscreen
controller plus an authenticated HTTPS setup page on port 3000. See the
[single-room setup guide](room-setup.md). This page is independent of the fleet frontend.
The legacy Python web interface on default port 8080 is also not started by the
agent; its authentication and service-method mismatches remain unresolved.

Dashboard-dependent rollout procedures elsewhere in this guide are design targets,
not verified instructions for the current standalone Pi build.

## 4. Device Preparation

### 4.1 Download or Build Image

**Option A: Download Pre-built Image**
```bash
# Download latest release
wget https://github.com/amirhmoradi/croom.to/releases/latest/download/croom-latest.img.gz
gunzip croom-latest.img.gz
```

**Option B: Build Custom Image**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/amirhmoradi/croom.to.git
cd croom/build

# Download base OS
./download-img.sh

# Prepare image (interactive)
./prep-img.sh
```

During `prep-img.sh`, you'll be prompted for:
- Device password (for SSH access)
- WiFi networks (SSID and password)
- Dashboard URL
- Enrollment token

### 4.2 Flash SD Cards

**Single Card:**
```bash
# Insert SD card and identify device
lsblk

# Flash image (CAREFUL: this erases the device!)
sudo dd if=croom-latest.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
sync
```

**Multiple Cards (Batch):**
```bash
# Using Balena Etcher (GUI)
# Or parallel dd:
for dev in /dev/sd{b,c,d,e}; do
    sudo dd if=croom-latest.img of=$dev bs=4M status=progress &
done
wait
sync
```

### 4.3 Label Devices

Create labels for each device:
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ Croom Device          │
│ Room: Conference A     │
│ MAC: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff │
│ Serial: PI-2025-001    │
└────────────────────────┘
```

Attach label to device and keep record in inventory.

## 6. Testing

### 6.1 Individual Room Test

**Test Script:**
```
1. Create test meeting 5 minutes in future
   - Invite room calendar
   - Use each platform (Meet, Teams, Zoom)

2. Verify auto-join
   - Device should join within 1 minute of meeting start
   - Video should be enabled
   - Audio should be enabled

3. Test basic controls
   - Mute/unmute audio
   - Enable/disable camera
   - Leave meeting

4. Test end-of-meeting
   - End meeting from another device
   - Room should return to idle state

5. Document results
```

### 6.2 Multi-Room Test

**Concurrent Meeting Test:**
```
1. Schedule meetings in all rooms at same time
2. Verify all devices join successfully
3. Check dashboard shows all devices in meeting
4. End meetings and verify all return to idle
```

### 6.3 Edge Case Testing

| Scenario | Test | Expected Result |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Network loss | Disconnect WiFi briefly | Reconnects automatically |
| Power loss | Unplug and replug | Reboots and rejoins |
| Double-book | Two meetings at same time | Joins first meeting |
| No meeting | No calendar events | Shows idle screen |
| Long meeting | 2+ hour meeting | Stays connected |

### 6.4 User Acceptance Test

```
